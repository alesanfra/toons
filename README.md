**A high-performance TOON (Token Oriented Object Notation) parser and serializer for Python.**

TOONS - Token Oriented Object Notation Serializer - is a fast Rust-based library that provides a Python interface mirroring the `json` module API, making it easy to work with the TOON format—a token-efficient data serialization format designed specifically for Large Language Models.

## Why TOON?

The TOON format achieves **30-60% fewer tokens** than equivalent JSON, making it ideal for LLM contexts where token count impacts costs and context capacity.

In this simple example we can achive -40% with respect to JSON:

**JSON (26 tokens):**
```json
{"users": [{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}]}
```

**TOON (16 tokens):**
```
users[2]{name,age}:
  Alice,25
  Bob,30
```

> **Note**: Calculations were done using Anthropic Claude tokenizer, you can experiment with different tokenizer [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/the-tokenizer-playground)


## Features

- 🚀 **Fast**: Rust implementation with PyO3 bindings
- 📊 **Token-Efficient**: 30-60% fewer tokens than JSON
- 🔄 **Familiar API**: Drop-in replacement for `json` module
- ✅ **Spec Compliant**: Full TOON Specification v2.0 support
- 🐍 **Python Native**: Works with standard Python types

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install toons
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import toons

# Parse TOON string
data = toons.loads("""
name: Alice
age: 30
tags[3]: python,rust,toon
""")
print(data)
# {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'tags': ['python', 'rust', 'toon']}

# Serialize to TOON
user = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "active": True}
print(toons.dumps(user))
# name: Bob
# age: 25
# active: true
```

### File Operations

```python
import toons

# Write to file
with open("data.toon", "w") as f:
    toons.dump({"message": "Hello, TOON!"}, f)

# Read from file
with open("data.toon", "r") as f:
    data = toons.load(f)
```
